# MakeoverMonday with D3.js

I am starting this as a weekend project and every Monday I will be posting a [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) chart created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

For those of you who are not aware of [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), it is a wonderful data visualization initiative started by [Andy Kriebel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andykriebel/) in collaboration with [Eva Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evamurray1/). Every week, a dataset along with a visualization which has a need for improvement will be posted on **MakeoverMonday** website. Though this is famous among Tableau users, participants are encouraged to use data viz tool of their choice and post improved version of their charts. According to Andy, the main objective of this initiative is to encourage _learning_, _practice_ and _reinforce_ data visualization best practices. Thank you Andy and Eva.

I will be using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations) as my tool of choice to create these charts. This exercise is to have fun using D3.js and learn along the way.

There is always room for improvement and I am open to constructive feedback. If you feel that the visualization/code could be improved, I would appreciate if you could let me know.

- Prototyping tool of choice: [Charticulator](https://charticulator.com/)
