# MakeoverMonday with D3.js

I am starting this as a weekend project and every monday I will be posting [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) charts created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

For those of you who are not aware of [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/). It is a wonderful data visualization initiative started by [Andy Kriebel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andykriebel/) in collaboration with [Eva Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evamurray1/). Every week, a dataset along with a visualization which has a scope of improvement will be posted on MakeoverMonday website. Though this is famous among Tableau users, participants are encouraged to use any data viz tool of their choice and post improved version of the charts. According to Andy, the main objective of this initiative is to encourage learning, practice and reinforce data visualization best practices. Thank you Andy and Eva.

I will be using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations) as my tool of choice to create these charts. This exercise is to have fun using D3.js and learn along the way.

There is always a room for improvement and I am open to constructive feedback. If you feel that the visualization/code could be improved, I would appreciate if you could let me know.
