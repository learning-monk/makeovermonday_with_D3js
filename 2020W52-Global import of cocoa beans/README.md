The objective of this challenge is to make this chart better so that the insights clearly stand-out.

**Here is what I came up with:**

This prototype was created using [Charticulator]("https://charticulator.com/) which is an opensource data viz tool for creating custom data visualizations.

For these projects, I prototype in _Charticulator_ and then I build the chart in _D3.js_.
